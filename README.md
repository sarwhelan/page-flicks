# PageFlicksWebApp
Created by Samantha Campbell & Sarah Whelan


## Source Code For Website
We used Angular, Node.JS, Express, and MySQL to make Page Flicks.
All code related to the website is in the ```src``` folder.

To view front end code, navigate to ```src > PageFlicks > src > app``` to view the components and services.
The server code/API is available in the ```src > PageFlicks > app.js``` file.


## SQL Commands
We used procedures to run all of our queries. We simply called them from our API and passed in specific parameters.

The code for these procedures is in the ```sql``` folder.
